# Real-Time Traffic Prediction and Optimization System üö¶

This repository contains the implementation of a **Real-Time Traffic Prediction and Optimization System** using advanced Machine Learning algorithms, cloud infrastructure, and multi-modal data integration. The system aims to enhance urban traffic management by predicting congestion, optimizing traffic signal timings, and suggesting alternate routes, ensuring smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion.
